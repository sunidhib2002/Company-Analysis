# Website-Analysis
<h4>About the Project: </h4>
<p>I have done extensive EDA on a website's dataset. The dataset has features like the type of customers, existing or new, the number of times a website has been accessed by a customer, the number of times a customer accessed the website and clicked a button, etc. I did data-cleaning, pre-processing, data visualiation and tried using rolling average for predicting the values for future.</p>
